[![GoDoc](http://img.shields.io/badge/go-documentation-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](http://godoc.org/github.com/aurelien-rainone/math32) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aurelien-rainone/math32.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aurelien-rainone/math32) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/aurelien-rainone/math32/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/aurelien-rainone/math32?branch=master)


Package `math32` provides basic constants and mathematical functions for 32 
bits floating point, based off the standard Go math package.

The documentation of every `math32` wrapper function is the same as the
equivalent function of the standard Go `math` package. Also, the tests are
heavily based off the tests of the standard Go `math` package. For those
