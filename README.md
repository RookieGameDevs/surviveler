Surviveler. The award winning game. Probably.

# Install

It will really speed up the Golang dev workflow while basically not impacting
the client one, if we have our game root dir lives inside a standard Golang
folder structure. So, once the $GOPATH is defined:

```
cd $GOPATH
git clone git@bitbucket.org:rookiegamedevs/surviveler.git $GOPATH/src/bitbucket.com/rookiegamedevs/surviveler
```
